VEGGIE RUN

A simple endless runner designed to be played by inexperienced gamers.

You control a set of moving teeth as they traverse the landscape.
Food items get in the way from the right side of the screen. There are two categories, healthy food and candy.

Healthy food: broccoli, corn, peapod
Candy: cotton candy, candy corn, wrapped piece of candy, peppermint

At the top of the screen is a health meter comprised of 5 teeth.

The player must avoid the candy by jumping over it. They can eat the healthy food.
Every time the player collides or “eats” a piece of candy one of the teeth will fall and disappear beneath the screen. When all five teeth are gone, the game is over.
